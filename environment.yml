  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  # --- Core runtime ---
  - python=3.10
  - libjpeg-turbo          # guarantees JPEG symbols for Pillow

  # --- Conda-native libraries (prefer conda wheels where stable) ---
  - numpy==1.24.3
  - pandas>=1.3.0
  - pytorch>=2.0  # pulls the Apple-Silicon (MPS) build
  - pip

  # --- Everything else goes through pip to ensure exact versions ---
  - pip:
      # General tooling
      - tqdm>=4.66
      - neo4j>=4.0.0

      # Text / NLP stack
      - sentence-transformers>=2.2.0
      - transformers>=4.49.1
      - accelerate>=0.20.0
      - torch>=2.0.0           # duplicate pin for pip coherence

      # Tokenizers and language models
      - sentencepiece>=0.1.99
      - tokenizers>=0.19.0
      - tiktoken>=0.6.0

      # Compatibility hard pins
      - protobuf==3.20.3       # transformers still requires <4
      - pillow>=10.3.0         # ships its own JPEG symbols

# Optional notes:
# • If you use CUDA instead of Apple MPS, replace the pytorch line with
#     - pytorch::pytorch==2.2=*cuda*
#   or install the official wheel separately.
# • PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 is still recommended in your shell profile to
#   prevent rogue user-site wheels from shadowing the env.
